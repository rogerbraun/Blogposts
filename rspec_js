# Here's the backstory.

I noticed that Codebrawl(codebrawl.com) does not yet support Github Flavored Markdown(http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) in Gist comments. Gist comments are loaded client-side via the Gist API and then rendered with showdown.js(https://github.com/coreyti/showdown). Showdown is a great project, but it does not support the extensions Github uses. This really sucks for comments which contain code, as they are rendered as regular Markdown-style code spans, which ignores newlines and indentation and makes them completely unreadable.

So I forked the project, added the necessary 30 lines of code and made a pull request. I "tested" my code the stupid way: Look at the output in the browser. This made me feel somewhat uneasy. I want this code to be useful, but how should anyone know that I did not break anything? I decided to add some tests. I have done testing in other languages, but never in Javascript. How do you do this?

# Testing your Javascript 

So you want to test your cool JS code. 

Something about testing in-browser.

Something about Jasmine.

# RSpec lookalike in 30 lines
